# RosaDealVR
VR tour of Rosa Deal School of Arts
We currently have 2 versions available. A normal PCBuild  that offers the tour with basic Keyboard and mouse controls.
The second build is for VR. This version offers the Tour for the Meta Quest 2. 

For both builds all you would need to do is run the .exe file and it should work, we have not implemented a stop or exit program button so you will need to tab out 
and close it.
